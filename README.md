Compile - JU
==========

A compiler for my language, JU! 

## Quick start with "Hello, world!":
* Main python lexer and parser: PLYex.py and drjb_parser.py * 
* Input JU files include the .ju extension

To run and evaluate the compiler, first clone the repo, navigate to the main directory and type the following into the terminal:

	python drjb_parser.py hello.ju 
	(or any other .ju file if you are bored with "Hello, world!")
Congrats! You have compiled your first JU program! Now let's go through how it all works.

## Syntax and grammar rules for JU language:
You may have noticed some similarities between JU and Python and Javascript. This is no accident! I took parts of both languages that I liked and mashed them together.
